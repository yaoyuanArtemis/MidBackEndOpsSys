Dear Admissions Committee,
I hope this email finds you well. My name is Liu Feng, and my application ID is C2547579. I applied to the SPML program at Nanyang Technological University.
Today, I learned that some of my classmates who have lower academic scores and less competitive academic and work backgrounds than me have already received offers. This has made me a bit anxious about my application status. So, I'm writing to politely inquire about the progress of my application.
I'm also facing a situation with the University of Hong Kong. The deferral period for the admission acceptance fee there is almost ending again. However, I truly prefer the SPML program at Nanyang Technological University. I'm really eager to know if there's a chance for me to receive an offer from your esteemed university.
Thank you so much for your time and assistance. I look forward to your reply.
Best regards,
Liu Feng
